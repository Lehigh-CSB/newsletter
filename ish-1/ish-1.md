## ‚Ö£. A New Monthly-Email ‚úâÔ∏è

<br />

**Another recurring email to add to the collection...** üôÉ, but unlike the others, it is tailored exactly to your Computer Science & Business (CSB) needs. Apologies in advance: as this is the new executive board‚Äôs first program-wide address it will be longer than usual. I can assure you though it's a good read, so sit down, go grab a cup of coffee ‚òï, and let's get started!

<br />
<br />

## ‚Ö§. The Executive-Board Strikes Back ü™ì

<br />

**Your CSBA 2022‚Äì23 Executive Board:** if you somehow managed to miss the other thousand messages about the election results from April... here‚Äôs us trying to cram it down your throat again.

**Our roadmap for success...** The board already had their first meeting[^1] in early May and put together an ambitious plan for the next academic year, including this regular newsletter, an overhauled CSBA first-year mentorship program, a shift in focus to multi-club-sponsored workshops, and the return of CSB-NYC. You can read our full-year roadmap [here](https://github.com/Lehigh-CSB/roadmap-22 "roadmap-22").[^GitHub]

<br />
<br />

## ‚Ö•. The Return of the GitHub üò∫

<br />

**A new place for discussion... or just notifications...** If you were at the board elections, some might recall a demand for a more organized place for discussion on registration than the semesterly slew of GroupMe messages (eg., Piazza). Another issue this year‚Äôs board wanted to address was task management and transparency. It just so happens though, that GitHub has a product line combination perfect üåü for these needs: a discussion forum with announcement, Q&A (can vote best answer), and general discussion channels; kanban-board-styled task views; and role-based permissions for separate public and member access.

We won‚Äôt publicly shame you for still inquiring in the GroupMe, but for everyone‚Äôs sanity, we ask you to move the questions that others might also have to this new space üëç.

<br />

 <!-- < Honestly, what is with all these Star Wars references... this madman must be stopped.  -->

**Congratulations...** While moving onto bigger and better things, we wanted to take this section to recognize the significant achievements üèÜ of our outgoing CSB seniors. Class of 2022, this is your first and last CSBA newsletter, but we're excited to be able to share it with you and to celebrate your graduation.
