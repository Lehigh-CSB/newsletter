<br />

**Hey CSBs,**

Should this be a thing? CSBees üêù? CSBiebers üï∫? CSBeavers ü¶´? CSBytes ? So many options :D

<br />

It‚Äôs that time of the month again! Welcome to the second issue of the Computer Science and Business Association Newsletter.

 > <small>P.S. this issue was delayed due to some technical difficulties. Thus, we compiled something a bit longer capturing events of June and July together</small>

## 0. `sudo chmod +x ` Andrea Goff üéâ

We want to introduce CSB‚Äôs newest advisor, Andrea Goff! Andrea has been at Lehigh for 10 years where she worked as a College of Education Coordinator, moved to the EES department as a coordinator, and is now with us as an advisor. She took on this role because she ‚Äúloves helping students and seeing them succeed.‚Äù Both of her kids study at Lehigh, so she understands the difficulties that come with advising. Some advice she has for the Class of ‚Äò26 - and really everyone - *‚ÄúGet involved! Don‚Äôt be afraid to try new things. You‚Äôll learn more about yourself. Especially look for experience that will help you in your career.‚Äù*

Andrea asks that you reach out to her with any questions about CSB! She‚Äôs ready to help with any questions you have. Keep in mind that she **just** came from the EES department :) Regardless, if you have a question about CSB, the EES track, or anything else Lehigh-related, feel free to email her at [ahg212@lehigh.edu](ahg212@lehigh.edu).
