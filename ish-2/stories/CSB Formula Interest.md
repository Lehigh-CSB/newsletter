Hello!

  


I hope your week is going well!  My name is Sarah de Lange and I'm reaching out to you on behalf of Lehigh Racing.  We are Lehigh's Formula SAE team that designs, manufactures, tests, and races a unique Formula 1 style vehicle.  We compete at an annual competition at the Michigan International Speedway against teams of students across the world.

  


In an effort to diversify our team we are looking for business/IBE/CSB students to help with the important non technical side of our organization.  Below is a list of potential projects, but we are excited to hear about any creative and innovative ideas you will bring to our group!

  


  * Project
    * Create new team website
    * Design vehicle livery
    * Social media coordinator
    * Develop marketing packet for EV sponsorships
    * Merchandise designer
    * Development of intra-team resource archive

We have longer meetings on Saturdays at 10:00AM and a short update meeting on Tuesday at 6:00PM, both in Packard Lab.  Time spent for new members tends to be about two hours a week but you are welcome to spend as much time as you like!

  


Email us at [insae@lehigh.edu](mailto:insae@lehigh.edu) or me at [snd223@leigh.edu](mailto:snd223@leigh.edu) and join our new member group me [here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://groupme.com/join_group/86445176/bDgBOuK0&source=gmail-imap&ust=1659707543000000&usg=AOvVaw3UakleBp0GJjFmg3b1_pA2) for more information.  We look forward to hearing from you!
