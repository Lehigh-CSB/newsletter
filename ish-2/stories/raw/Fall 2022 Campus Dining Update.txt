Beginning this semester, there will be **no fees for pick-up orders** from on campus dining locations. As an added bonus, you'll score free delivery through Grubhub+ Student until you graduate if you're a student, and as long as you have a valid lehigh.edu email address if you are a faculty or staff member.

With the much-anticipated [renovation of the Clayton University Center (CUC)](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://facilities.lehigh.edu/capital-projects-planning/clayton-university-center-cuc&source=gmail-imap&ust=1660333636000000&usg=AOvVaw0tvbE3eBODAGyWdSyeaL5H) set to begin in late 2022, we will begin to make adjustments to some of our operations this fall and into Spring 2023.  Please rest assured that although the renovation of the CUC will necessitate some changes, we will provide ample options for dining in Spring 2023. Our goal, as always, is to provide outstanding service and food offerings for the campus community. Watch for more details about the spring semester later this fall.

We look forward to seeing and serving you soon.
