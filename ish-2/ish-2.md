## 0. Meet Andrea Goff üéâ

We want to introduce CSB‚Äôs newest advisor, Andrea Goff! Andrea has been at Lehigh for 10 years where she worked as a College of Education Coordinator, moved to the EES department as a coordinator, and is now with us as an advisor. She took on this role because she ‚Äúloves helping students and seeing them succeed.‚Äù Both of her kids study at Lehigh, so she understands the difficulties that come with advising. Some advice she has for the Class of ‚Äò26 - and really everyone - *‚ÄúGet involved! Don‚Äôt be afraid to try new things. You‚Äôll learn more about yourself. Especially look for experience that will help you in your career.‚Äù*


Andrea asks that you reach out to her with any questions about CSB! She‚Äôs ready to help with any questions you have. Keep in mind that she **just** came from the EES department :) Regardless, if you have a question about CSB, the EES track, or anything else Lehigh-related, feel free to email her at [ahg212@lehigh.edu](ahg212@lehigh.edu).

<br />

## 1. Reminder for Class of 0x2026 ü§ñ

**Hello, Class of 2026**‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs us again! We would like to give y'all some quick reminders.

## 10. Hash Mail Map ‚úâÔ∏è

Can‚Äôt find the email for specific information on something or for an event? Don‚Äôt stress because you will find the same email here. This will be a recurring section where we will put emails sent from the College of Business or P.C.

<br />

## 100. A Little Alumni Advice üë©‚Äçüéì

>*‚ÄúTry to take advantage of all events hosted by CSB, both networking and social. Creating a big network will be extremely beneficial as you complete your degree and beyond. There are Lehigh people everywhere and you never know when you‚Äôll run into someone, either it is at a job opportunity or living in the same city after graduation.‚Äù* **Komal Grover ‚Äò20, former Alumni Relations Chair and Professional Development**

## 101. Decrypt the Newsletter üß©
