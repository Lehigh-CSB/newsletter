## ‚Ö°. üåπGrowing Strong (Mentorship program)
Even though we did not have any Mentorship Program events since the last ISH (besides distributing gifts to the CSBA Hackathon winners), we hope you are taking advantage of having a mentor assigned to you - especially during a pre-registration period!

One month without any events is going to be compensated with two exciting events upcoming in the last day of classes:
- **Technical + Behavioral Interview Workshop with CCPD** - Nov 30 @ 4:30pm - 7:30pm, Location TBD
    - We are collaborating with the Center for Career and Professional Development to prepare you for behavioral and technical interviews.
    - You will learn tips and tricks for your interview, explore STAR method, and have a brainstorming session with CCPD to prepare your responses for the behavioral part of the interview.
    - After that you will have an opportunity to have a mock interview with upperclass CSB students where you will solve LeetCode type questions and answer behavioral questions.
    - Please, stay tuned for more information via CSBA GroupMe and Handshake.
    - Pizza is providedüôÇ
- **CS Research Opportunities Fair** - Dec 2 @ 2:30pm - 6:30pm, Location TBD (Likely RB)
    - What is research? Do you want to do research but do not know where to start? Why do you even need research? We invited professors and researchers from Lehigh‚Äôs CSE department to help you figure out these questions.
    - At this event, professors will share their tips for pursuing research, and talk about their research and opportunities for undergrads in their lab in the form of a 5-minute pitch.
    - Invited faculty include:
        - Dr. Hank Korth | Lehigh Blockchain
        - Dr. Aparna Bharati | Computer Vision Group
        - Dr. Arielle Carr | Quantum Computing and Optimization Lab
        - Dr. Dominic DiFranzo | Human-Computer Interaction & Social Computing
        - Dr. Roberto Palmieri | Scalable Systems and Software Research Group
        - Dr. Maryam Rahnemoonfar | Bina Lab
        - Dr. Brian Chen | Informatics Lab
    - Stay tuned via CSBA GroupMe chat!

<br />

## ‚Ö¢. üêüCommittees, Duty, Honor
Do you want to be more involved in the CSBA? Well, you can by joining one of our five committees: **Professional Development Committee, Technical Development Committee, Social Committee, Communications Committee, and Resources Committee**. With these committees, you would work with the head chair to implement ideas, work on projects, and host events. With the committees, it will foster a great learning and growth environment within the CBSA. If you want to join any of the committees or have any questions, email the head chair of the committee.

- **Professional Development Committee**: Kayla Kraft - kak524@lehigh.edu
- **Technical Development Committee**: Max Colen - mrc324@lehigh.edu
- **Social Committee**: Evan Jenkins - eaj224@lehigh.edu 
- **Communications Committee**: Juhi Grover - jug225@lehigh.edu 
- **Resources Committee**: Carl Freyer - ckf225@lehigh.edu 

<br />

## ‚Ö£. üê∫ Registration is Here
It‚Äôs that time of year again! It‚Äôs registration time! To elevate some tension, this is a quick rundown for how it goes. Here‚Äôs the schedule: 

- **Seniors**: Nov 14 @ 7:15am
- **Juniors**: Nov 15 @ 7:15am
- **Sophomores**: Nov 16 @ 7:15am
- **Freshman**: Nov 17 @ 7:15am

Make sure you know when you are registering and set your alarm clocks for the right time! Also, **Class of 2026**, quick reminder: y‚Äôall register on Thursday at 7:15am, unless you have sophomore standing, meaning you came in with 24 credits or more. 

You should have already received your PIN or are waiting for it. If you do not get your PIN two days before your registration date, email Andrea or Kalafut the afternoon before your registration day. 

With that, we also suggest you make multiple plans, so you have different schedule options and backup classes. If you have any questions or concerns, reach out to the advisors, your friends, the CSB Groupme, or any of the CSBA E-Board members. Good luck!

<br />

## ‚Ö§. ü¶Å A CSBA Eboard Always Pays their Debts
A lot has happened since the last newsletter has come out, so click [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/161eAKebvIjkpgG_WADAUVF6wwPR3VMuFIVIrBtWRi8s/edit?usp=sharing) to read what we have been up to. Trust us, you don't want to miss it üòâ

<br />

## VI. ‚òÄÔ∏è Unacademic, Unretired, But Great Advice
‚ÄúFind YOUR people. At the core, we are built to be social beings. Friends will get you through tough times, but also bolster you through your successful times. Find people like you; find people different from you; but most importantly, find people you can trust. I would not be where I am today without my network and friends.‚Äù 

- Evan Choy ‚Äò20, IT & Specialized Assurance Consultant at Deloitte

If you want to meet Evan and ask him any questions, pop out to our Alumni Talk with him on Friday, November 18th from 4:30 - 5:30pm over Zoom.

<br />

## VII. ü¶Ö As Confusing as Usual 
This one is going to be even trickier because not only do you have to guess the theme but you have to put the name associated with each title in order! (some emojis give it away :P)

Put in your guess [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScSvfwBQlxx1qPm0x8Y3BHGB0IprhgOzoJxvZdDzBvE9h4c6g/viewform).


<br />

## VIII. ü¶å Ours is the Farewell
And that‚Äôs a wrap for this month‚Äôs newsletter. Be sure to check out the upcoming events, and good luck with registration!! Also, have a safe Le-Laf weekend and Thanksgiving Break! See y‚Äôall next time‚úåÔ∏è
