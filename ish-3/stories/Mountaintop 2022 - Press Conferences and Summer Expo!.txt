CREATIVE INQUIRY
Mountaintop 2022 - Press Conferences and Summer Expo!
Dear Lehigh Community,
The Office of Creative Inquiry is very pleased to invite the entire Lehigh campus community to "Press Conferences" for the 2022 Mountaintop Summer Experience - involving 180 Lehigh students and 25 Lehigh faculty working on 36 distinct, innovation-driven projects - which will take place July 18th, 20th, and 22nd. 
What are Press Conferences? Public presentations where each project team presents their work for 7-8 minutes, followed by 10-12 minutes of open discussion where attendees can ask questions, get clarification, offer feedback and advice, etc. Mountaintop's press conferences will be structured in six groups of 5-6 teams each, so you can attend one, two, or all of them! Each session is themed, with project-based innovations in the areas of Education, Behavior, Community, Financial, Technology, and Health.
Press Conferences will be delivered in person in Building C, room 115, but a Zoom option for attendees is available. REGISTER HERE for a list of projects at each session, dates and times, and to receive final confirmation and Zoom links. Visit the Mountaintop Summer Experience web page for brief descriptions of projects. 
Also...mark your calendars for the afternoon of Thursday, August 4th for the Summer Research Expo! Project teams from Mountaintop, STEM-SI, the Marcon Institute and other summer research programs will be presenting their work in an open poster showcase. Building C is the location. More details forthcoming.
