Speaking from Mountaintop, President Joseph J. Helble ’82 describes some of the many research and educational activities in which Lehigh students, faculty and staff are engaging this summer.           
"Lehigh is an active and vibrant research and educational community during the summer months, with more than 100 courses being taught this year, research, conferences, and athletic activities taking place, and programs that welcome everyone from K-12 students to global visitors pursuing research or education. Planning for the launch of our fall’s university strategic planning effort is also well underway."
